        "This study aims to compare the performance of three machine learning classification methods: Decision Trees, naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), utilizing two distinct datasets—Wine and Iris. The analysis focuses on the classification accuracy and error rates, evaluated through confusion matrices under two different training/testing splits: 80% training and 20% testing, and 50% training and 50% testing. The optimal number of neighbors for the k-NN classifier is determined through experimentation. Results indicate varying performance levels among the classifiers depending on the dataset and training scenario, providing insights into their applicability for classification tasks in different contexts.\n",

        "Machine learning has transformed data analysis by enabling automated decision-making processes across various domains. Among the numerous algorithms available, Decision Trees, naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) are frequently employed due to their interpretability and effectiveness in handling classification tasks. This research investigates the performance of these methods using two well-known datasets: Wine and Iris.\n",

        "Comparative analysis of the classification methods—Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—on the Iris and Wine data sets reveals that both the decision tree and the Naive Bayes classifier excel in terms of precision. In particular, the Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best results on the Iris dataset, with an accuracy of 97.33%, while the Decision Tree achieved 100% perfect performance on the Wine dataset under a training ratio of 80. .%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The k-NN method, although effective, showed more variable results, with accuracies reaching up to 96.00% in Iris and 93.26% in Wine. This suggests that although k-NN may be a viable option, probability-based and decision tree-based classifiers tend to offer more robust and consistent performance on these data sets.\n",

        "These findings indicate that the choice of classifier may depend on the specific context and characteristics of the data set, and underline the importance of evaluating multiple algorithms to determine the most appropriate approach in classification tasks."
